    缺失模块。<br>
    1、请确保node版本大于6.2<br>
    2、在博客根目录（注意不是archer根目录）执行以下命令：<br>
    <span style="color: #f75357; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 2rem;">npm i hexo-generator-json-content --save</span><br>
    3、在根目录_config.yml里添加配置：
    <pre style="color: #787878; font-size: 0.6rem;">
jsonContent:
  meta: false
